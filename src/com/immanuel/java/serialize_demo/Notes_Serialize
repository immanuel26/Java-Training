$ Serialization :

* When we want to make an object to travel over the network (OR) to get converted into file format, Then that object must be serializable.
       -> The process of converting Object state into network transferrable format (OR) file format is called Serialization.
       -> The process of converting network transferrable format (OR) file format to a Object state is called De-Serialization.

$ Serializable :
       -> This is an interface which present in java.io package.
       -> This interface does not have any methods.
       -> In java if an interface without methods is called MARKER INTERFACE.

$ Transient :
       -> When we dont want a particular property not to be participate on serialization then we need mark that property as transient.

$ Static :
       -> Serialization is the process applicable only for Object not for class level data. So for static variables,
          Serialization is not applicable.
