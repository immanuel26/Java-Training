We Can Write :

1) A class inside another class.
2) A class inside interface.
3) A interface inside a class.
4) A class inside a method.

INNER CLASSES :

@ Regular Inner Classes -> When you want to make without creating outer class, If you don't want to create inner class
                           we use Regular Inner Classes Pattern.
         # Examples : public class Country
                      {
                          private String name;
                      }
                      public class State
                      {
                          private String name;
                      }

* Object creation for Regular Inner class :
         # Examples : Country country = new Country("Canada");
                      Country.State state = country.new State("Toronto");

* We cannot write static methods. So, We cannot write main method also, Which means we cannot run regular Inner Class as main() method application.

* We can access outer class data (Variables and method) inside inner class including static.

@ Anonymous Inner Class -> A Class without name. When we need a class only one time in our project we use anonymous class.
