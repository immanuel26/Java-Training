JAVA.io----------------------------------------------------------------->Package which helps us to perform IO operations on file using java.

1. java.io.File :
        * Constructor => File file = new File("Path of file");
        * Important methods on file class ::
               # exists()
                     -> returns 'true' when the file is present in the location.
                     -> returns 'false' when the file is not present in the location.
               # createNewFile()
                     -> returns 'true' if the file is created.And the new file will create when then the file does not exists on given path.
                     -> returns 'false' when the file is already exists on given path.
               # mkdir()
                     -> creates new folder on given path.
                     -> returns true when folder creation is success/false when creation got failed.

2. FileWriter :
        * Using FileWriter when we write data into file the data will be appended to the file at the end. There so method from FileWriter
        to print data on new line. To print using FileWriter on a new line, we should call -> fw.write("\n");

3. FileReader :
        * Constructors :
               # FileReader fr = new FileReader(String path);
               # FileReader fr = new FileReader(File File);

4. PrintWriter :
        * Constructors :
               # PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(String path);
               # PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(File file);
               # PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(Writer writer);
        * Methods :
               # write(int ch)               # print(char)            # println(char)
               # write(char[])               # print(double)          # println(int)
               # write(int data)             # print(float)           # println(boolean)
               # write(String)                    ||                  # println(String)
               # flush()                          ||                  # println(Object)
               # close()                          ||

5. **IMPORTANT**
        *PrintWiter and BufferedReader will be used most frequently.
