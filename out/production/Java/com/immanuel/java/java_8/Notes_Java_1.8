Marker Interface : Interface without methods......ex: Serializable.

Functional Interface : Interface with exactly one abstract methods.....ex: Runnable.

Functional Programming(Lammbda expression)
          -> For only Functional Interface we can write lambda expression.

* Interface name is not required.
* Access Modifier is not required.
* Method Return type is not required.
* Name of the method is not required.
* Methods input type parameter typers are not required.
* -> Should be there in between method parameters and method body.
* If Input parameter count is exactly one, Then () are optional.
* If The lambda expression body is exactly one then {} are optional.
* If the lambda expression body is exactly one then return keyword are optional.
* We should lambda expressions only for the interface which are annotated with
  @FunctionalInterface(Though it is optional it is always recommended)
